The groom's hair is anointed with oil and he showers using soap-nut powder, except this time where the groom will definitely only shower using Old Spice. The bride goes through a similar ritual. She changes into a new sari and is made to sit down for the 'muth aarthi'- a traditional '<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarti#Practice" target = "_newtab">aarthi</a>' performed for her with a lighted 'diya' (lamp), 'kumkum' and flowers.

The bride's father intervenes and advocates for the superiority of married life to an ascetic life. He also promises his daughter as a companion to face the challenges of life. The groom accepts and returns to the wedding venue to get married.</p>

The groom holds the 'thaali' in his hands and recites a religious verse. He then ties it around the neck of the bride, he makes the first knot and the two others are completed by his sister. The three knots symbolize Brahma, Vishnu and Rudhra. Flowers are showered on the couple as a blessing.

			<h5>Sapthapadi</h5>
			<p align = "justify">

He stops, bends down and holds the right toe of his wife with his right hand and helps her take seven steps around the fire. At the beginning of each step, he recites a Vedic mantra seeking the blessings of Maha Vishnu. As these seven mantras are being chanted, he asks Maha Vishnu to follow in the footsteps of his wife and bless her with food, strength, piety, progeny, wealth, comfort, a yacht and health.
