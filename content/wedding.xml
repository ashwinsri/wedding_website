		Janavasam is the Tamil (notably TamBrahm ) equivalent of a North Indian Baraat.
		In the good ol'days, the groom's party (usually half his village) traveled to the bride's village and sauntered through the main thoroughfare for the whole village to do a dekko before repairing for the festivities. The need for this quaint ritual no longer exists, but us Desis cannot give up rituals simply because they are dated. Instead, we build an even more spectacular and bizarre theatre around them.

		<li>There's a second engagement ceremony. The couple (ok lets be honest, the couples' parents) re-confirm that they want to go through with the wedding.</li>
